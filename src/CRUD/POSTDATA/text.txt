Stateful: In a controlled form, the value of each form input element (like <input>, <textarea>, or <select>) is controlled by the state of a React component. This means that you store the input's value in a component state variable.

Synced with State: The input element's value attribute is set to the corresponding state variable, and it also has an onChange event handler that updates the state variable whenever the input changes.

Advantages:

React maintains a single source of truth for the form input value, making it easy to access, validate, and manipulate.
You can implement complex interactions, such as conditional rendering or form submission, based on the controlled values.
